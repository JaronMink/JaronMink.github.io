Farhan is a PhD student in Computer Science at Arizona State University. He is interested in understanding how users interpret ambiguous or manipulated information in AI-mediated media ecosystems, how these interpretations influence privacy and trust, and how system design can harness strengths in human factors while mitigating vulnerabilities. Before starting his PhD, he completed his undergrad at KUET in Bangladesh and spent a brief period teaching there as a lecturer.
