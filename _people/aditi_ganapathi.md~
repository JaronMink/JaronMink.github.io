Aditi is a graduate student in Computer Science at Arizona State University. She is interested in the synergy between AI and human beings and aims to build responsible large language models. Her current favorite question is: <em>What are effective methods to identify and mitigate hidden biases in generative AI systems?</em> Outside of AI, she enjoys playing badminton and finding the next best hot chocolate recipe.
