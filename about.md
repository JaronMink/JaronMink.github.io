### Who are we?

We are a group of researchers discovereing how to better protect people by understanding how people interact with software. While we work on many areas of computer security, we primarily focus on the quickly evolving landscape of Machine Learning (ML), understanding how to defend against new forms of ML-Abuse, and how to harness ML-powered tools for security systems.


### Research

Our work discovers how human interaction impacts ML security in two ways: How human factors can be 1) exploited to reduce security and 2) harnessed to improve security. Since ML-enabled abuse is becoming increasingly common, I investigate how lay users perceive and react to new attacks, e.g., how social media users react to deepfakes [[USENIX Sec. 2022](), [CHI 2024]()]. As ML is beginning to be applied in security-critical systems, I evaluate how usable these tools are for technical users, e.g., how easy it is for ML developers to apply security defenses [[USENIX Sec. 2023](), [IEEE SP 2023]()].

The best way to understand what we're currently working on is to look at some of the newest publications by our lab members!

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, molecular biology, metascience, cognitive science, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://kordinglab.com/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Weekly 'lab teachings' where someone teaches a thing. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. 'One-on-ones'. Every semester everyone in the lab is expected to sit down with everyone else for an hour.
0. Lab tea time. It's tea! And science. A 10-minute talk by someone about anything, including their current work.
0. Coding overviews. Structured like the one-on-ones
0. A lab hammock, hangboard, and art on loan from the Penn Museum
0. Monday morning donuts @ 9:00am

Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things.
