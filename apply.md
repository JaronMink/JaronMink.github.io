Our lab is always recruiting talented, motivated students! We have several positions open.

For all emails relating to position inquires, please be specific about why you are interested in the lab and what project you would like to work on (this is not binding, it's just useful to get a sense of interest!).
Please do not send a generic copy-paste email, Jaron unfortunately cannot respond to every email and these are unlikely to receive a response.

<h3>Prospective PhD Students</h3>

We're hiring several PhD students for the Fall 2025!
If you are interested in joining the lab please:
1. [Submit an application](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESCOMSCPHD/computer-science-phd?init=false&nopassive=true) to ASU's PhD program and note that you are interested in working with Jaron Mink in the application.
2. Send [Jaron](https://jaronm.ink/) an email and let them know: (1) you applied, (2) any relevant prior experiences you may have, and (3) what you are interested in researching during your PhD! Please add the following to the beginning of the email subject line (including the square brackets): [New PhD Student Inquiry]. 


<h3>Paid Apprenticeships</h3>
Maybe you're interested in a PhD but would like to build up your resume or preview it before starting? Consider doing an apprenticeship!

As part of the Cybersecurity and Trusted Foundations Center at ASU, we sponsor six-month apprenticeships each summer and winter. During this time, you will work with faculty and graduate students on a self-contained project that results in an academic publication! The goal of this program is to get you an awesome resume-building experience to talk about, and an amazing recommendation letter. The time commitment is generally 32 hours per week for six months, and it is intended for people who are either not students or who can take full-time from their studies to pursue research.

[Learn more about the program and the deadlines here](https://ctf.asu.edu/education/apprenticeship-program/)! *Note: applications close about ~6 months before the apprenticeship starts. Be sure to apply early!*

Additional we also offer the [Summer Research Initative](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/suri/) (SURI) for undergraduate and graduates from across the globe to work with our lab for eight-weeks during summer.


<h3>Paid Research for ASU Master's/Undergraduate Students</h3>
If you're a current ASU student and are interested in research during your degree, ASU has an amazing set of programs that will let you work with our lab!
Masters student's can apply through [MORE](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/more/) and Undergraduate students can apply through [GCSP](https://gcsp.engineering.asu.edu/research-stipend/) (if you are a GCSP student) or [FURI](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/).

You may be able to be funded for additional semesters of research through the Happy Lab!
