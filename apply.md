Our lab is always recruiting talented, motivated students!

<!--Please do not send a generic copy-paste email, Jaron unfortunately cannot respond to every email and these are unlikely to receive a response.
For emails relating to position inquires, we instead highly encourage you to simply apply through the lab's [application form](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESCOMSCPHD/computer-science-phd?init=false&nopassive=true)-- all applicants will be reviewed, but unfortunately, the same cannot be said about emails!
-->

<!--please be specific about why you are interested in the lab and what project you would like to work on (this is not binding, it's just useful to get a sense of interest!).-->

<h3>Prospective PhD Students</h3>

We're hiring several PhD students for the Fall 2025!
If you are interested in joining the lab please:
1. [Submit an application](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESCOMSCPHD/computer-science-phd?init=false&nopassive=true) to ASU's PhD program and note that you are interested in working with Jaron Mink in the application.
2. [Submit a corresponding application](https://asuengineering.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5avW0LfJ4RhJxyK) through the Happy Lab (ASU's system can quite slow and this will help Jaron get back to you much quicker).

<h3>Current ASU Masters & Undergraduate Students</h3>

If you're a current ASU student and are interested in research during your degree, ASU has an amazing set of programs that will let you work with our lab!
Masters student's can apply through [MORE](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/more/) and Undergraduate students can apply through [GCSP](https://gcsp.engineering.asu.edu/research-stipend/) (if you are a GCSP student) or [FURI](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/).
If you aren't part of these programs but wish to still perform research, please submit an [application here instead](https://asuengineering.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5avW0LfJ4RhJxyK).

Research will often require you to commit to a project for at least 6 months (after hearing about the project, of course). We strongly prefer to bring students into the group in their first or second year of undergrad so that there's a possibility of a long-term collaboration if the fit is right.



<h3>Post-docs</h3>

The best way to do this would be to flag Jaron down at a conference you're both at and chat! 


<h3>External Interships</h3>
Maybe you're interested in a PhD but would like to build up your resume or preview it before starting? Consider doing an apprenticeship!

As part of the Cybersecurity and Trusted Foundations Center at ASU, we sponsor six-month apprenticeships each summer and winter. During this time, you will work with faculty and graduate students on a self-contained project that results in an academic publication! The goal of this program is to get you an awesome resume-building experience to talk about, and an amazing recommendation letter. The time commitment is generally 32 hours per week for six months, and it is intended for people who are either not students or who can take full-time from their studies to pursue research.

[Learn more about the program and the deadlines here](https://ctf.asu.edu/education/apprenticeship-program/)! *Note: applications close about ~6 months before the apprenticeship starts. Be sure to apply early!*

Additional we also offer the [Summer Research Initative](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/suri/) (SURI) for undergraduate and graduates from across the globe to work with our lab for eight-weeks during summer.
